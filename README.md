## Overview

The challenge was to build a multi-page-like experience as a Single Page Application (SPA), ensuring it looks great on all devices and follows accessibility best practices.

**Users are able to:**

- Navigate through all pages (Home, Destination, Crew, and Technology) without page reloads.
- Interact with all elements using keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space).
- Experience smooth Fade-In animations when switching between data.
- View a fully responsive design from mobile to desktop.

## My process

Since it was my first or second time using json I felt really lost, and work on a slow pace, but thanks to doing research online I could manage to finish the project as it's suppose to work. I'm proud of the result and even though I know I should keep practicing to be able to improve my times I'm extremely satisfied with this one.
